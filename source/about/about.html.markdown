### Activities

*Reddit Game JAM 06*: Submission: “thunderbolt”. A game jam is a gathering of game
developers for the purpose of planning, designing, and creating one or more
games within a short span of time, usually ranging between 24 and 48 hours. Game
developers are generally made up of programmers, game designers, artists, and
others in game development-related fields.
Submission page. March 2011.

*Stega*: A steganography set of tools that embeds a file into the LSB's of
another. Code Repository. March 2011.

*HN Warning Words*: Chrome extension that highlights a user defined list of words
in hackernews comment pages. Code Repository. April 2014

*Reverse Engineering Game*: A puzzle about reverse engineering. Code Repository.
April May 2014. WIP.

### Other Studies

AWK: The AWK language is a data-driven scripting language consisting of a set of
actions to be taken against streams of textual data – either run directly on
files or used as part of a pipeline – for purposes of extracting or transforming
text, such as producing formatted reports. The language extensively uses the
string datatype, associative arrays (that is, arrays indexed by key strings),
and regular expressions. April 2011

Bison: GNU bison, commonly known as Bison, is a parser generator that is part of
the GNU Project. Bison reads a specification of a context-free language, warns
about any parsing ambiguities, and generates a parser which reads sequences of
tokens and decides whether the sequence conforms to the syntax specified by the
grammar. Bison by default generates LALR parsers but can also create GLR
parsers. May 2011

Flex: is a free software alternative to lex. It is a computer program that
generates lexical analyzers ("scanners" or "lexers"). It is frequently used with
the free Bison parser generator. May 2011.

Code to Complete 2: (from amazon summary)Widely considered one of the best
practical guides to programming, Steve McConnell’s original CODE COMPLETE has
been helping developers write better software for more than a decade. Now this
classic book has been fully updated and revised with leading-edge practices—and
hundreds of new code samples—illustrating the art and science of software
construction. Capturing the body of knowledge available from research, academia,
and everyday commercial practice, McConnell synthesizes the most effective
techniques and must-know principles into clear, pragmatic guidance. No matter
what your experience level, development environment, or project size, this book
will inform and stimulate your thinking—and help you build the highest quality
code.
